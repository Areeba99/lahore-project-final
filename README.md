# lahore-project-final

My project is a Lahore App which is blog + e-commerce. More focus was on e-commerce part, so it is not complete.
The tabs Home, Souvenir Shop, Contact Us are working.

Technologies used are:
> MERNSTACK is implemented.
> Client side rendering is done in React.
> For styling, bootstrap, css and material-ui are used.
> Express app with mongodb for back-end and api.
> All crud capabilities are working.
> JWT based authentication.
Functions:
> Login and Signup are working. For admin login, email: admin@admin.com, password: admin. 
> Only the admin can perform crud operations of Adding, Updating or Deleting a product.
> Shopping cart is not complete but price/quantity buttons are working.
> On the home page, Images open up in modals.
> For storing product images, I have used Imgur.
